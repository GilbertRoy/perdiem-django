Hey ______ 

We're excited for you to start using the new PerDiem site! We'll be rolling things out this weekend at Mind The Music - San Francisco and you'll be able to be the first to use the new site and invest in Artists at the event. 

We added your information from the previous site so you will be able to login using your previous e-mail and see your investments:

To login with Facebook or Google, make sure that your email on those platforms matches {{email}}.

Over the next few months you'll be able to see updates from the artists you invested in and once their music is released you will start to see the money that you earn from it. If you don't want anyone to know you are investing, you can go to SETTINGS and select "Invest Anonymously." 

If you have any questions please e-mail us at: support@investperdiem.com
