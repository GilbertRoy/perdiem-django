                                Traditional crowdfunding platforms only allow you to "donate" or "pre-order" music through perks by artists. With PerDiem you are actually investing in a project and can make a monetary return if the project is successful. This creates an incentive for the investors to promote the music long term since the success of their investment is tied to the success of the artist.

                                No, you don't own any equity in the artist or their music. The artist sets a percentage they want to give back to the investors based on revenue for that project.

                                It's totally up to the artist. Every label is different in the deal they negotiate with artists. Since the music is already released, it's unlikely that a label would want to pull it and collect revenue from a past project. If they do, you can simply give your remaining shares to the label or work out a deal with your investors where everyone wins.

                                The system is designed to protect both the artists and the fans. If an artist decides to leave the platform we highly encourage them to do it in a way that doesn't upset or disappoint their investors.

                                Yes. Since the band retains full ownership of their music, and makes the choice to "give back" to their fans, there is no need to have contracts between the artists and the fans. You are simply purchasing a record (or multiple records) from the artist and the artist is rewarding you for doing so.

                                100% of the money from shares purchased goes to the artists, and 100% of revenue is split between the artist and fans. The only additional cost for the fans is the credit card processing fee + $1 to make the transaction (this $1 covers costs of keeping the platform running).

                                For example: You invest $10 in an artist. It costs $1.41 to process that transaction. $10 goes to the artist, $1 goes to Perdiem, $.41 goes to the credit card company.
